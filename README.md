# Search-Reddit
A bot that searches through one or more  subreddits, looking for specified keywords in the subreddit submissions. If the keywords are  found, the post is sent to a specified user, using reddit's private message system.  The script begins by asking the user what reddit user to send the submissions to, then asks for subreddits to search in, then asks for keywords. Lastly, the user is asked how long the bot should sleep for after each search.  The bot then runs indefinitely (unless the user  terminates the program manually), searching through the first 100 posts in the subreddit, and sleeping a specified number of seconds after each search.
